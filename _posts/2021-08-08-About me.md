title: "About me"
---

I am a physical oceanographer. In 2013, I received my bachelor's degree in Marine Sciences at Ocean University of China and decided to pursue a career in oceanography. In the same year, I moved to the U.S. and became a graduate student in Physical Oceanography at [Duke University](https://www.duke.edu). During my graduate studies and many years beyond, I strived to understand an important ocean circulation system on earth - the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) - by investigating its structure, variability, circulation pathways and forcing mechanisms. I paid particular attention to the deep ocean component of the AMOC because of its critical role in carbon uptake and ocean ventilation. In 2018, I received my Ph.D. at Duke and was appointed as a Postdoctoral Research Associate there.

In 2019, I was offered a position at the [Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI)](https://www.whoi.edu) as a Postdoctoral Investigator. During the 2 years at WHOI, I switched my research focus to smaller scale processes in the North Atlantic - the (sub)mesoscale eddies. I was mostly interested in the eddy activities below the ocean surface, which is less observed or studied. Throughout my research, I love to view problems from different aspects by combining various types of data and methodologies. 

In fall 2021, I will move back to China and start a faculty position at [State Key Laboratory of Marine Environmental Science & College of Ocean and Earth Sciences, Xiamen University](https://mel2.xmu.edu.cn/melwebold/en/). More fun to come!
