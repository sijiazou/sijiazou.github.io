I am a physical oceanographer at [State Key Laboratory of Marine Environmental Science & College of Ocean and Earth Sciences, Xiamen University](https://mel2.xmu.edu.cn/melwebold/en/). My research interest lies in understanding ocean circulation and its role in the climate system. More specifically, I focus on:

* The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation: variability and forcing mechanisms
* Deep ocean circulation in the North Atlantic
* Water mass analysis
* Subsurface coherent vortices
* Lagrangian and Eulerian methods
