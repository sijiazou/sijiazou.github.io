## On the Linkage between Labrador Sea Convection and the AMOC

> While strong convection in the Labrador Sea induces important changes of temperature and salinity in the basin interior, the export of these property anomalies to the boundary current largely takes place along density surfaces. As a result, the diapycnal transformation - the imprint on the AMOC - is relatively small. This finding highlights the critical relationship between temperature and salinity in determining the overturning strength in the Labrador Sea and underlines the necessity of accurate freshwater flux estimates for improved AMOC predictions.

Figure: Observed weak diapycnal transformation (numbers in black) at OSNAP-West (i.e. across the Labrador Sea). Colors show mean velocity perpendicular to the section, with density contoured in gray. Numbers represent the estimated transport (unit: Sv) in  each density layer: red (blue) number denotes the total flux into (out of) the basin and black denotes the net. Black arrows indicate directions of diapycnal transformation. WGC: West Greenland Current; LC: Labrador Current. Time period: August 2014 - June 2016. In contrast to the weak diapycnal transformation, transformation in Î¸-S space is 3-4 times stronger, suggesting significant density compensation (isopycnal mixing) in the Labrador Sea.

## Deep Ocean Circulation in the Subpolar North Atlantic

> In order to understand deep circulation in the subpolar North Atlantic, 125 floats were released at depths > 1800 m along the rim of the subpolar basin. They drifted in ocean for a maximum lifetime of 2 years. The float program is a part of the Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program (OSNAP).

Figure: Trajectories of the floats after launch (launch locations are indicated as black circles). Bottom topography from 1000 m to 3000 m is shaded in color. CGFZ: Charlie-Gibbs Fracture Zone; ISOW: Iceland-Scotland Overflow Water; DSOW: Denmark Strait Overflow Water; NEADW: North East Atlantic Deep Water. 

### Based on the float trajectories, spreading pathways of the Iceland-Scotland Overflow Water (ISOW) in the eastern North Atlantic are revised. For more information, see [Zou et al. 2017. Progress in Oceanography](http://doi.org/10.1016/j.pocean.2017.10.003).

Figure: Revised pathways (blue curves) for ISOW in the eastern North Atlantic based on floats. Volume transports (Sv) for major branches from a high-resolution ocean model are labeled in blue, compared to transports reported in previous studies (magenta). Percentages in red indicate the Lagrangian quantification of ISOW pathways.

### Can upper-layer eddies influence the deep water spreading pathways? Float observations show that eddy and meandering activities associated with the North Atlantic Current could determine the ISOW pathways near the Charlie-Gibbs Fracture Zone (CGFZ).

## Subsurface Eddy Activities near Greenland

> Lagrangian float trajectories reveal abundant cyclonic rotations below 1800m near the southern tip of Greenland. The cyclonic rotations are very likely associated with the propagating Denmark Strait Overflow Cyclones, which are generated by vortex stretching associated with the overflow descent south of the Denmark Strait. The cyclones could influence the boundary currents around Greenland by introducing transport and property anomalies. For more information: Zou et al. 2021. Journal of Physical Oceanography.

Figure : If a float shows cyclonic rotation in its trajectory, the location of the rotation is marked as a red circle. If it shows anti-cyclonic rotation, it is marked as a blue circle. Black line represents the 10-day trajectory segment associated with each rotation.
