* Weak diapycnal transformation (numbers in black) suggests a small contribution of Labrador Sea to the AMOC.

  Figure: Observed mean velocity perpendicular to the OSNAP West section, with density contoured in gray. Numbers represent the estimated transport (unit: Sv) in  each density layer: red (blue) number denotes the total positive (negative) flux and black denotes the net. Black arrows indicate directions of diapycnal transformation. WGC: West Greenland Current; LC: Labrador Current. Time period: August 2014 - June 2016.

However, in contrast to weak diapycnal transformation, transformation in Î¸-S space is 3-4 times stronger, suggesting significant density compensation (isopycnal mixing) in the Labrador Sea.
